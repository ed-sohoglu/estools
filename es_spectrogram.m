% Gaussian spectrum
% 	s = GaussianSpectrum(input, increment, winLength, samprate)
% 	Compute the gaussian spectrogram of an input signal with a gaussian
% 	window that is given by winLength. The standard deviation of that
% 	gaussian is 1/6th of winLength.
%	Each time frame is [winLength]-long and
%	starts [increment] samples after previous frame's start.
%	Only zero and the positive frequencies are returned.
%   to and fo are the time and frequency for each bin in s and Hz
%   pg is a rumming rms.
